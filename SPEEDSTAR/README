I made this small game at my first year second semester project course. It's coded in c++.
Description: A car will have to reach it's destination by moving away from different automated obstacles on it's way.herer
              Failing to reach the destination in certain time will result in "game over,succeeding" will take the player to next level.
              There are five levels added here.You can also choose the color of the car at the beginning of the game.
